file compressor and decompressor

JavaFX File Compressor/Decompressor
This is a complete, runnable desktop application built with JavaFX that provides a graphical user interface to compress (zip) and decompress (unzip) files and folders.
The core logic uses the java.util.zip package.
Project Deliverables
1.	Source Code: All source code is included in the src directory, structured as a standard Maven project.
2.	Executable File: You can create an executable .jar file from this Maven project using the command mvn package. The resulting .jar will be in the target directory
Features
â€¢	Compress Multiple Files: Select one or more files to add to a new .zip archive.
â€¢	Compress Folder: Select an entire directory to compress into a .zip archive, preserving the folder structure.
â€¢	Extract ZIP: Select a .zip file and a destination directory to extract its contents.
â€¢	Progress Bar: A progress bar shows the status of the compression/extraction based on the number of files processed.
â€¢	Logging: A text area logs all actions, including which files are added/extracted and the final statistics.
